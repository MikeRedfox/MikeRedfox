- 👋 Hi, I’m @MikeRedfox
- ⚛️ I’m interested in learning how to code. My first approach to a programming Language was during my first year of University (Chemical Engineering student) with Matlab. I loved the idea of making something of your own and not doing some of the work on paper 
- 🐍 Later on I started learning Python in my spare time 
- 🌐 Currently I'm learning HTML,CSS and JS as I'm growing an interest for web Development
- 📫 You can reach me on 🐦[Twitter](https://twitter.com/GuardaMichele) or follow me on 📷[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/michele__guarda/)

### Happy coding !
