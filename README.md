- Hi, I’m @MikeRedfox
- My first approach to a programming Language was during my first year of University (Chemical Engineering student) with Matlab. I loved the idea of making something of your own and not doing some of the work on paper 
- Later on I started learning Python as well as go,c++, and SQL. 
### Happy coding !
